This code is basically adapted from:
https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/PlotsSMS

To run the code

1) prepare your python environment to use ROOT
You can just do cmsenv from a CMSSW directory or
export ROOTSYS=/usr/ROOT/root
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=${PATH}:${ROOTSYS}/bin


2) prepare a root file with the 2D histogram (temperature plot) and the six lines to display:
- observed limit 
- observed limt +/- 1 sigma on the theory xsec
- expected limit
- expected limit +/- 1 sigma

3) prepare a config file similar to the example provided (see config/SUS14015/T2bw075_SUS14015.cfg)

Run the code as

python python/makeSMSplots.py yourconffile labeloutput
where
- yourconffile is the relative or absolute path to your conf file
- is the label for the output plots. 

e.g. for the 1 lepton stops analysis 

python python/makeSMSplots.py config/SUS14015/T2tt_SUS14015.cfg T2tt -b
python python/makeSMSplots.py config/SUS14015/T2bw025_SUS14015.cfg T2bw -b
python python/makeSMSplots.py config/SUS14015/T2bw050_SUS14015.cfg T2bw -b
python python/makeSMSplots.py config/SUS14015/T2bw075_SUS14015.cfg T2bw -b

would create three plots

T1ttttRA2bBAND.pdf   <-- plot with 1 sigma band (Brazilian-like plots)	
T1ttttRA2bCONT.pdf   <-- plot with color contour	 
T1ttttRA2bXSEC.pdf   <-- temperature plot
